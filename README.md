# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

# Travel Destinations React App

## Overview

This is a **React** application built using **Vite** as the build tool, and **Bootstrap** for the user interface. The app showcases popular travel destinations, each with price information. Users can interact with the application to explore various travel destinations, get details about each, and see attractive images and pricing. This app is designed with a clean, responsive UI using Bootstrap components for smooth navigation.

### Features

- **Popular Destinations**: The app displays popular travel destinations (e.g., Paris, Greece, Norway, Tuscany) with an interactive gallery of images and price listings.
- **Responsive Design**: Built with Bootstrap for responsiveness, so it adapts well to different screen sizes.
